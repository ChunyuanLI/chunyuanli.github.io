I am a senior researcher at [Microsoft Research, Redmond](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-redmond/). My recent research focuses on large-scale pre-training in computer vision and natural language processing. Some recent works include: 

- Vision-and-language pre-training [[1](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/objects-are-the-secret-key-to-revealing-the-world-between-vision-and-language/), [2](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/141089155)] 
- Self-supervised visual reprensetation learning [[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09785)]
- Deep generative models at scale [[1](http://chunyuan.li/doc/Scaling_DGMs_chunyl.pdf), [2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/a-deep-generative-model-trifecta-three-advances-that-work-towards-harnessing-large-scale-power/), [3](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/122250953)]

I completed my PhD in machine learning at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/), advised by Prof. [Lawrence Carin](http://people.ee.duke.edu/~lcarin). My PhD research studied [probabilistic deep learning](http://chunyuan.li/doc/PhD_research_cli.pdf).
